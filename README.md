# Regression-Shrinkage

This repository contains a pdf with quick summary of Shrinkage methods.

Followed by the code for the exercises in the PDf.

I generated these for the PhD Workshop Econometrics III: Adcanced Econometrics & Statistical Learning at TUM

The code and the exercises are motivated and adapted from [Matteo Courthoud's Machine-Learning-for-Economic-Analysis](https://github.com/matteocourthoud/Machine-Learning-for-Economic-Analysis/blob/master/notebooks/05_regularization.ipynb)
