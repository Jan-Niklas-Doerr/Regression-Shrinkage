# Regression-Shrinkage

This repository contains a PDF with a quick summary of shrinkage methods.

Followed by the code for the exercises found in the PDF.

I generated these for the PhD Workshop Econometrics III: Advanced Econometrics & Statistical Learning at TUM from Prof. Farbmacher

The code and the exercises are motivated and adapted from  [Matteo Courthoud's Machine-Learning-for-Economic-Analysis](https://github.com/matteocourthoud/Machine-Learning-for-Economic-Analysis/blob/master/notebooks/05_regularization.ipynb)
